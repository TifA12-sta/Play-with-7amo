# Play with 7amo

A simple 2D action game created with Pygame, featuring a soldier's battle against the humorous enemy "7amo" (حمو).

## About the Game

"Play with 7amo" is my first game development project, born from my desire to create games without getting overwhelmed by complex game engines. While Unity and Godot seemed daunting at first, I discovered Pygame - a Python library that proved to be the perfect starting point for my game development journey.

In this game, players control a soldier who must defeat an enemy named "7amo" (a funny name commonly used in Egypt). The objective is to shoot 7amo while avoiding physical contact. Each successful hit increases your score, but touching 7amo will cost you 5 points!
